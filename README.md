<h1>Description</h1>

<p>This dice game website allows two players to roll virtual dice, with the winner determined based on the higher roll. JavaScript controls the dice roll logic, updates the images dynamically, and displays the result (Player 1 wins, Player 2 wins, or a draw). The CSS styles create a visually engaging layout, featuring custom fonts, a ludo board background, and shadow effects on the dice images and headings. The site is simple, responsive, and offers a fun, interactive experience.</p>
